<h1>  2023-2024 UIUC Basketball Analysis Project </h1>

<h5> 11/23/23 </h5>

<h2> Description </h2>
  
In this STAT 107 (Data Science Discovery) project from my freshman year, I was given free reign to choose any data set and analyze it in a variety of ways. As an avid college sports fan, I chose to investigate the UIUC men's basketball and their performance through their first six games of the 2023-2024 season. Using Python, I was able to observe which players have been performing above and below the team averages thus far. I also created a histogram and a correlation matrix to test my hypothesis that a higher 3P% for an individual player coincides with a higher scoring output.

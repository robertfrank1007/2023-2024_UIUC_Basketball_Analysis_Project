<h1>  2023-2024 UIUC Basketball Analysis Project </h1>
<h4> 11/23/23 </h4>
<h2> In this STAT 107 (Data Science Discovery) project from my freshman year, I was given free reign to choose a data set and analyze it. As an avid college sports fan, I chose to
investigate the UIUC men's basketball and examine how they have performed through their first six games of the 2023-2024 season. Using Python, I was able to observe who has been performing above and below average for the team thus far. I also created histograms and a correlation matrix to test my hypothesis that a higher 3P% for an individual player coincides with a higher scoring output. </h2>
